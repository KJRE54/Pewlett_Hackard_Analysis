# **PEWLETT_HACKARD RETIREMENT ANALYSIS**
### GW Bootcamp Mod 7 Course Lesson SQL Project

## Overview of the Analysis ---
The purpose of this analysis by Pewlett-Hackard is intended to “future proof” the company by assessing how many employees will be retiring and determine who among the group of employees is eligible for a retirement package.  The company leadership also wants to set up a mentorship program with participating eligible retirees to ensure business continuity in job roles. 
The analysis required evaluating how many employees in each department were ripe for retirement and to sell the idea of taking a scaled-back job role in lieu of retiring permanently in order to mentor newly hired employees in their department. 


## Analysis Results of Deliverables ---

Based on the analysis, the Four major points that are notable as it relates to the number of Retiring Employees by Title and Mentorship Program employees eligible for retirement are:

+ Future employees set to retire represent 80% (or 71,890 people) of the retiring titles which include: Sr. Engineers (33%), Senior Staff (31%) and Engineers (16%).

+ Within the future retiring population, there are 7 retiring titles across 9 Departments. There are 2 managers currently eligible to retire in the Sales Dept. and in the Research Dept.

+ There are 1,549 current employees that are eligible for retirement who could be recruited by Pewlett-Hackard into the Mentorship Program as part-time employees.

+ Among the pool of potential Mentorship Program eligible programs, there exists 286 Senior Engineers, 422 Senior Staffers, and 403 Engineers that could stay to support business continuity and knowledge transfer.

## Summary Response ---
(1) As the "silver tsunami" begins to impact the company, there will be a need to replace 90,398 employees that will be exiting for retirement.
(2) There may not be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor in the most impacted roles for Sr. Engineers and Sr. Staffers, unless there are enough employees within the ranks to be promoted to these senior roles and then have new hires added on.
